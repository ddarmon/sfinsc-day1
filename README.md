# Day 1 -- Network Data Analysis

## Downloads

Before we get started, we need to install several applications for working with network data. Today, we will be using Gephi and R, along with a few of their packages.

We will be using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for network visualization:

* [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)

Gephi requires that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If the JRE is not already installed on your computer, download it here:

* [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

For data analysis, we will be using R:

* [R](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)

A nice Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R can be found here:

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/)  

Finally, for additional network analysis tools, will use the igraph library for R. Installing new libraries into R is a little different than a usual software install. 

* [igraph](http://igraph.org/r/)  

## The Data Sets

To introduce network visualization and analysis, we will be working with four data sets: a collaboration network from IMDB, a correlation network from S&P 500 companies, a link network   from political blogs, and a voting record network from the US House of Representatives.
