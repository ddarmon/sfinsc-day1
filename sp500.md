# S&P 500 Correlation Network

## The Data

The data consists of the closing prices of the XYZ companies in the S&P 500 from XYZ to XYZ and from XYZ to XYZ. For each company, we compute the log returns for their stock. For example, here is the log returns for Apple:

## Data Cleaning

We will be investigating networks constructed via pairwise correlations between the log returns of each company in the data set. Correlations can be very sensitive to outliers in a data set, and thus we first [Winsorize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorizing) the log return time series for each company before computing correlations.

Many statistical procedures have assumptions
