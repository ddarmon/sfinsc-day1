# S&P 500 Correlation Networks

In this example, we will analyze a network constructed from associations in the log returns of stocks listed on the [Standard & Poor's 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index).

## The Data

The data consists of the closing prices of the companies included in the S&P 500 Index over three periods: from 2003 to 2007, from 2008 to 2012, and from 2013 to 2016. For example, the closing prices for Ventas (VTR) and Simon Property Group (SPG), two real estate companies, from January 1st, 2003 to December 31st, 2007 are below:

</p>

As we can see, the stock prices for these two companies tend to move in a similar direction. For each company in the S&P 500, we have a time series of their closing prices over time. Our goal is to gain an understanding of the organization of the companies in the S&P 500 based on the co-movement of their stocks. For example, we know that a high default rate amongst subprime home mortage holders in 2007 contributed to the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), which impacted the real estate, mortgage, and banking industries. Thus, we would expect companies in these sectors to be highly associated over time, with weaker associations to companies outside of these sectors.

When working with stock market data, it is common to consider the log rate of return for a stock rather than the raw stock price itself. That is, if the closing price on day *t* is *P<sub>t</sub>*, then the log rate of return *P<sub>t</sub>* is

Here are the log rates of returns for Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) and Prologis (PLD):

</p>

We still see a clear association between the two companies: when log return is positive / negative for one, it is positive / negative for the other, and vice versa. One nice way to inspect this relationship is to consider the scatter plot of the log returns of VNO on a particular day against the log returns of PLD on a particular day:

</p>

Each point here corresponds to a particular day, and we see graphically the association between the two companies' log returns. For a linear relationship like this, we can summarize the relationship between the companies using [Pearson correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). For these two companies, the correlation between their log returns is 0.84.

Contrast this with another pair of companies, Walmart (WMT) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM). Their closing prices, log rate of returns, and scatter plots are shown below:

</p>

Clearly, there is a weaker assocation between the log returns of these two companies: the correlation between their log returns is 0.12. This is unsurprising, given that they function in completely different sectors of the economy.

## Network Construction

The three correlation networks are in the ``data/corr-adjmat`` directory, and are stored as weighted edge lists in the files ``sp500-{1, 2, 3}.edges``, where the index corresponds to which period of time.

> **Explore:** Open ``sp500-1.edges`` using Sublime Text and investigate how the network is stored. Choose two of your favorite companies, and find the edge associated with those companies. Does the correlation between them match what you would expect?

As we can see from the header

> source target weight type

each line of the file corresponds to an undirected edge from company A to company B, with the weight corresponding to the pairwise correlation between the log returns of the two companies.

> **Explore:** Load the correlation network ``sp500-1.edges`` into Gephi as an undirected, weighted network. Use File > Import spreadsheet... Be sure that ``Separator:`` is set to the proper delimiter and ``As table:`` is set to ``Edges table``.

> **Explore:** In the Data Laboratory, copy over the company names as the labels for the nodes.

## More Explorations

Because there is an edge between each node in the network (we have computed a pairwise correlation between each pair of log returns), the network is complete: for 406 nodes, there are 82215 edges possible.

> **Explore:** How do you determine the number of edges in an N node network? Hint: count the number of ways to pair each node with one of the other nodes, and account for duplicates from overcounting A -- B and B -- A.

So a first step in working with this data is to use Gephi's filtering capabilities. Gephi can filter on node or edge attributes. In this case, we would like to filter out the edges corresponding to weaker correlations in the network.

> **Explore:** Use Filters > Edges > Edge Weight to filter for edges with strong pairwise correlation. Try different thresholds of correlation.

> **Explore:** After filtering the edges, run the Force Atlas 2 layout. What clusters of companies appear? Investigate some of the clusters. Do they make sense based on the economic sectors of the companies in the cluster?

> **Explore:** Investigate the networks stored in ``sp500-2.edges`` and ``sp500-3.edges``.  Re-run the analyses from the Explores above. Do the networks appear similar between time points? Different? How so? What types of changes might you expect based on economic changes between the time periods?

## Using a Statistical Model Explicitly &mdash; The Gaussian Graphical Model and the GLASSO

In your Explores, you have constructed a sequence of networks with varying strengths of correlations between the stocks. You may have noticed that a lot of the stocks are highly correlated: this is to be expected, since we know that different sectors of the stock market tends to move together. However, we also expect to find clusters of stocks that move together more similarly than others, for example stocks in the auto industry, or in the financial sector.

One way to investigate this type of behavior is by introducing a statistical model that tries to capture these relationships. One such model, a [Gaussian Markov Random Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_random_field#Gaussian), attempts to capture the conditional dependence and independence relationships between the log returns of the companies such that an edge is absent between two companies if they do not appear associated after accounting for all of the other companies. The Gaussian Markov Random Field model and the [approach we use to fit it (GLASSO)](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/glasso/) are fairly technical, so we will not address them here. The edge lists generated using this model are in ``data/corr-adjmat``.

> **Explore:** Import the networks stored in ``data/corr-adjmat/sp500-{1,2,3}.edges`` into Gephi. How does the GLASSO network differ from the correlation networks? Rerun some of the analyses you performed above. Are the clusters of companies similar between these two approaches?

> **Hint:** Because GLASSO will sparsify the network (*i.e.* returns a network with far fewer edges than the complete graph), some of the nodes may not appear in the ``.edges`` files. To include all of the nodes in your analysis, you can import the ``data/corr-adjmat/sp500-{1,2,3}.nodes``files using File > Import spreadsheet... Be sure that ``As table:`` is set to ``Nodes table``.
